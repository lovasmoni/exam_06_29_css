          <h2>Emergence of scaling in random networks</h2>

          <p>
            Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the world wide web are
            best described as networks with complex topology. A common property
            of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a
            scale-free power-law distribution. This feature is found to be a
            consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks expand
            continuously by the addition of new vertices, and new vertices
            attach preferentially to already well connected sites. A model based
            on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary
            scalefree distributions, indicating that the development of large
            networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go
            beyond the particulars of the individual systems.

          <h2>Statistical mechanics of complex networks</h2>
          <h6>

            Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and
            society. Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of
            chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network
            of routers and computers connected by physical links. While
            traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it
            is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real
            networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article
            reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks,
            focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and
            dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the
            recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and
            analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free
            networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the
            interplay between topology and the network’s robustness against
            failures and attacks.
